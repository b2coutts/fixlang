Extend libraries
    - Implement string handling functions

update documentation to reflect !, import, and Error.

May want to rewrite the entire thing
    - make strings fundamentally be lists
        - car and cdr work on them anyway so they are essentially lists, and the
          current idea of them sort of behaving like lists but not really is
          stupid
    - should solve some existing problems before rewriting the entire codebase
      again


Laziness issue
    - The problem is fundamental; in order to parse the program correctly, let
      values must be evaluate (to know how many arguments they will take)
