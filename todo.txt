Fix laziness issue
    - Errors partially fixed it, but the following code infinitely loops:
        - + if 1 0 let a $[0] a 45
    - For some reason, without the + it's fine. There's some issue causing the
      let to evaluate its expression, even though the value of a is never
      actually referenced

import libraries directly from the .fl file, rather than in command-line args
    - will probably want to put something in Parse.hs for this; change parse so
      it looks for import statements at the beginning, and throw an error if
      there are any import statements in the body

Extend libraries
    - Implement string handling functions

update documentation to reflect !, import, and Error.

May want to rewrite the entire thing
    - make strings fundamentally be lists
        - car and cdr work on them anyway so they are essentially lists, and the
          current idea of them sort of behaving like lists but not really is
          stupid
    - should solve some existing problems before rewriting the entire codebase
      again
